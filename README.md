# Reed-Solomon Encryption

This project was done as part of the SM 404 / A computational introduction to Number Theory course. We have implemented an integer version of the Reed-Solomon error-correcting code in Python as part of our project. The implementation can handle input messages with an upper bound $M = 10^{1000}$. The python library [gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been used to efficiently handle large numbers.
